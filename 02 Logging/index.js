// Logging is the process of recording messages, errors or information
// Logging plays a key role whenever we stuck in a many situations (like debugging, monitoring, troubleshooting).

//for that, we use 'console' object available in js

console.log("Hello World!") // .log(message) is method in console object used to log information.

// you can log the information based on their behaviour and level of logging

console.log("This is a log message"); // General information and by default everyone uses it.
console.info("This is an info message"); // Informational messages
console.warn("This is a warning message"); // Warnings
console.error("This is an error message"); // Errors
console.debug("This is a debug message"); // Debugging details

// Use these methods based on your usecase, to make things as ruled. 
// To experience the difference b/w the above statements run the 'index.html' in browser and open console on it.
